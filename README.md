### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello!!.. I am **Aadesh Varude**, a graduate studet of  Masters of Science in Robotics engineering at **[Worcestor Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://www.wpi.edu/)**, Massachusetts, USA. I have a Bachelors in Technology in Elecetronics nad Communication Engineering from **[Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology](https://vnit.ac.in/), Nagpur, India**. I am a member and Treasurer at IvLabs (The robotics club of VNIT). I wish to work and learn more in the field of **Robotics and AI**
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning and advancing my knowledge in Computer Vision via the Classical and Deep Learning approaches.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Reinforcement learning to combine with the controls algorithm. 
- I have recently worked on designing a walking and kicking trajectory on a humanoid robot. My recent work also includes object detection (for a ball and goal) using YOLOV4 and also implemented some classic computer vison appraoaches for horizon detection.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on working with the Reconfigurable robots and implementing my knowledge for the best of performance and use.
- My previous work involves a [**Reconfigurable Quadrupedal Bipedal Sanke Robot**](https://github.com/HarshadZade/QuadraSnake) (For video [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUigwOep0qc&t=2s))
