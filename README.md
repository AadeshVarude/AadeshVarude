### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello!!.. I am **Aadesh Varude**, a junior year undergraduate student at **[Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology](https://vnit.ac.in/), Nagpur, India**, pursuing bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am a member and Treasurer at IvLabs (The robotics club of VNIT). I wish to work and learn more in the field of **Robotics and AI**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning some optimal controls algorithms and implementing them on my Reconfigurable Robotics locomotion.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Reinforcement learning to combine with the controls algorithm. I have recently worked on designing a walking and kicking trajectory on a humanoid robot. My recent work also includes object detection (for a ball and goal) using YOLOV4 and also implemented some classic computer vison appraoaches for horizon detection.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on working with the Reconfigurable robots and implementing my knowledge for the best of performance and use
- My previous work involves a [**Reconfigurable Quadrupedal Bipedal Sanke Robot**](https://github.com/HarshadZade/QuadraSnake) (For video [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUigwOep0qc&t=2s))
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
